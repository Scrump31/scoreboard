#Scoreboard Web App
----
This project includes a scoreboard that users can add and delete players as they please.
In addition to adding/removing players, the total score of all players is dynamically added together based on updated scores.
The scoreboard has a 1 minute countdown timer that can be used to keep track of player rounds.

The project includes many great features of react & redux such as transitions and redux-form validation.
